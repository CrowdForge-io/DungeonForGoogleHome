# DungeonForGoogleHome

Reasons Dungeon was rejected:

v1:
Must have prompts for user input at the end of all output
Service went down during testing

v2:
Some dungeon output is longer than 120 s (that's the max)

v3:
"Restart" is not implemented. "Please make sure that a user can complete all core conversational flows listed in your registration information or *recommended by your app*."

v4:
Paging zork output caused the app to crash.
The reviewer attempted to get the app to "move to the house", "look in the mailbox", "turn around", to which the app would respond "I don't understand that. I thought you said, "what is in the mailbox". Returning to game. What do you do next?".
