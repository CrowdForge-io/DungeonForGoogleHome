# DungeonForGoogleHome

Reasons Dungeon was rejected:

v1:
Must have prompts for user input at the end of all output
Service went down during testing

v2:
Some dungeon output is longer than 120 s (that's the max)

v3:
"Restart" is not implemented. "Please make sure that a user can complete all core conversational flows listed in your registration information or *recommended by your app*."
